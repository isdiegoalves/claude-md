# File System as State

The file system is your most powerful general-purpose tool. Stop holding
everything in context. Use it actively:

- Do not blindly dump large files into context. Use bash to grep, search,
  tail, and selectively read what you need. Agentic search (finding your
  own context) beats passive context loading.
- Write intermediate results to files. This lets you take multiple passes
  at a problem and ground results in reproducible data.
- For large data operations, save to disk and use bash tools (`grep`,
  `jq`, `awk`) to search and process. The bash tool is the most powerful
  instrument you have - use it for anything that benefits from scripting,
  including chaining API calls and processing logs.
- Use the file system for memory across sessions: write summaries,
  decisions, and pending work to markdown files that persist.
- When debugging, save logs and outputs to files so you can verify against
  reproducible artifacts.
- Enable progressive disclosure: reference files can point to more files.
  Structure reduces context pressure. The folder structure itself is a form
  of context engineering.
