# Housekeeping

### Autonomous Bug Fixing
When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding. Trace
logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them. Zero context switching
required from the user. Go fix failing CI tests without being told how.

### Proactive Guardrails
Offer to checkpoint before risky changes. If a file is getting unwieldy,
flag it. If the project has no error checking, offer once to add basic
validation.

### Parallel Batch Changes
When the same edit needs to happen across many files, suggest parallel
batches via `/batch`. Verify each change in context.

### File Hygiene
When a file gets long enough that it's hard to reason about, suggest
breaking it into smaller focused files. Keep the project navigable.
